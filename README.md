* BS, Bioinformatics, University of California - Santa Cruz
* AS, Mathematics & Physics, Grossmont Community College


### Work Experience
* (2015 - Present) - Lab Technician | Donor Coordinator | Data Analyst - _Fertility Center of California_
  - Data Analysis & Reporting: Analyze data of small to medium size (100s – 10,000s) data sets using Excel and Google Sheets (Pivot Tables, advanced formulas) to identify treatment and timeline trends, optimize protocols, and improve patient outcomes.
  - Data Visualization: Designed Tableau visual reports to present to visually convey data, enabling faster data-driven decision-making by clinical teams.
  - Data Wrangling: Cleaned, transformed, and consolidated medium-sized healthcare datasets from multiple sources to ensure data integrity and usability for clinical and business intelligence reporting.
  - Database Management: Queried MySQL databases to retrieve information and managed FileMaker Pro by creating custom layouts, performing data audits, and analyzing datasets to support clinical and operational decision-making.
  - Regulatory Documentation: Authored lab protocols and submitted regulatory documentation to ensure compliance with FDA.
  - Cross-functional Communication: Served as liaison between patients, donors, and clinicians—translating data insights into actionable care plans.
  - Strategic Initiatives: Created and scaled the Donor Coordinator role, increasing donor acquisition by 30% in 18 months and leading multiple $100K+ business development projects under tight timelines.

* (2013 - 2014) - Undergraduate Researcher - _Jack Baskin School of Engineering_
  - Genomic Data Analysis: Investigated Neanderthal–human admixture timing using linkage disequilibrium patterns and comparative genomics (1000 Genomes Project).
  - Utilized Python, R, shell scripts, and VCFTools for data filtering, statistical analysis, and visualization.
  - Authored undergraduate thesis under Dr. Richard “Ed” Green, contributor to the Neanderthal genome project.
